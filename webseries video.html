        <p>*You Me Her* is a romantic dramedy series centered around the unconventional love story of a suburban couple and a young woman. Set in Portland, Oregon, it follows Jack and Emma Trakarsky, a married couple experiencing a midlife crisis in their relationship. Seeking to reignite their romance, they engage Izzy, a graduate student and escort, initially as a one-time arrangement. However, this evolves into a polyamorous relationship that challenges societal norms and their own preconceived ideas about love and commitment.

It aired for five seasons from 2016 to 2020, with the story delving into how the trio navigates societal judgment, personal insecurities, and the complexities of their three-way relationship.</p>
